# SPE_
SPE_ or 'Simple Processor Emulation' is a emulated processor which runs simple. It currently lacks certain qualities of real processors and still needs work but it should get better over time.

# Features:
Five 8-bit Index/Accumulator Registers
655356 bytes of memory or 64kb

# Note:
This is a alpha or something, I have made multiple of these sorry. But mainly there will be issues with this and some features are not probably added and will be added soon.

# Future Plans:
The plan currently is to get a working kernel and some programs going but the future future goal is to have the processor more realistic with a bus and cycle accuracy including more accurate memory and some other chips emulated to go along with this.
