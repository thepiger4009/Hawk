# SPE_
SPE_ or 'Simple Processor Emulation' is a emulated processor which runs simple. It currently lacks certain qualities of real processors and still needs work but it should get better over time.

# Features:
Five 8-bit Index/Accumulator Registers
655356 bytes of memory or 64kb

# Note:
When using the aac or more known as the 'Assembler and Compiler', you should keep any .string calls at the end or begging on a file or else it messes with the loadAddress. I'll fix it in the future.
