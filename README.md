# SPE_
SPE, stands for 'Simple Processor Emulation'. This project is my attempt at making a system or fantasy computer using my knowledge of CPUs and python including golang. It currently is lacking features like a proper bus, cycle count, timing, io, and a system board for that matter. It currently still doesn't have a working compiler or kernel/OS but it does have a working assembler.

# Future of SPE_
Starting as of 9/14/22, more effort will be put torwards the compiler and improving the SPE_ core itself and making it more realistic.

# Working as of 9-14-22 12:00AM
- Assembler
- SPE_ Core

# Not Working as of 9-14-22 12:01AM
- Compiler

# 9-14-22 Plans
- Work on compiler variables and arrays
- Start work on improving SPE_ core running on golang
